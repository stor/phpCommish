phpCommish v.2 for lrb5-leagues

Warning: I do not take any responsibility for the usage of the code.
You use it at your own risk.

Prerequisites
=============

* A web-server that supports php version 4.1.0 or later
* A mysql-server version 4.1 or later

No web-server?
==============

If you do not have access to a web-server with these requirements, you can use
a stand-alone web/php/mysql-installation on your computer to run the
application.

There are many alternatives to choose from. For the windows-platform there is
Appserv at http://www.appservnetwork.com/

Install this application following the instructions on the website, and then
follow the installation instructions below.

Installation
============

1. Put the files and folders into a directory on the web-server.
2. Create a database on the mySQL-server.
3. Run the "create_tables.sql" file to create and populate tables
   in the mySQL-database you created.
3. Create a user with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE privileges
   on the database if you haven't done so already.
4. Edit the sql_connect.php-file in the edit-folder and replace
   demo in "mysql_connect('localhost','demo','demo')" with the
   username and password for the user you created in step 3.
5. In the same file, replace 'phpc_lrb5' with the name of the database
   you created in step 2.
6. Browse to the directory on the web-server and start using it.

Notes
=====

Everyone with access to the "edit" folder will be able to edit your league. If
you want some sort of basic user authentication, use your web-servers functions.
On apache this is handled by the htaccess-files.

Good luck!
