phpCommish v.2 for lrb5

phpCommish for the Living Rulebook 5 rules

What is phpCommish ?
     A simple web-based management system for BloodBowl leagues using mySql and php.

Goodness:

    * Manage multiple leagues, during multiple seasons in multiple divisions
    * Easy display of the leagues matches and teams
    * Display results in table and list per division
    * Based on Living Rulebook 5
    * Easy updating of results in the league
    * Tracks td's, cas's, winnings, gate and comments per game
    * Update team player name, stats, skills, niggling and miss game, spp's
    * Update team name, coach, rerolls, fanfactor, assistant coaches, cheerleaders, apothecary, treasury
    * Automatic calculation of player values and team value
    * Export roster for use in other BloodBowl-apps
	  (SkiJunkies JavaBloodBowl, PBeM tool - NB! I have not tested the rosters in these applications)
    * Can also be used as a team-editor to manage your BloodBowl-team

Point system:

    * 3 points win
    * 1 point draw
    * 0 points loss
    * If points are equal, td-difference decides who's better
    * If points and td-difference are equal, cas-difference decides who's better

Strangeness:
	* When you mistakenly rise a players stats, and lower it again, the player
	  value is not lowered. This is according to rules, because the player value
	  does not decrease, even if you get a SI-result of decreased stat. If you
	  do this, you have to delete the player and add it back in adjusting the
	  stats and skills.
